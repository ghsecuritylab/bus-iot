This is an USB Host Mass Storage and File System example.

After the USB Flash memory stick is connected it creates/overwrites 
a file with name "Test.txt" and content "USB Host Mass Storage!".

Board:                  ST 'STM32F429I-Discovery'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32F429ZI'
Clock Settings:         XTAL       =   8 MHz
                        CPUCLK     = 168 MHz
                        USB HS CLK =  48 MHz
User Interface:         none

The program is available for target(s):

  - STM32F429 Flash: Downloads to and executes from internal Flash

IMPORTANT NOTE:
  - 5V have to be provided externally (for example on P1 connector), as because
    diode between 5V from USB ST-LINK connector lowers the voltage that is not
    any more within specified USB limits (it is lower than USB minimum of 4.75V)
