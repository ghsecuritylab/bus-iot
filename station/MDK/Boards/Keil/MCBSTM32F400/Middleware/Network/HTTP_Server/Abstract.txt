This is a HTTP_Server example. It shows you how to use the
Web Server CGI interface as well.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/Network/html/_compact__web__server__example.html

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). The example will configure the network
parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect an evaluation
board to PC directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case
configure a PC to use a static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable
a 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in Net_Config.c configuration file.
The default static IP address of this example is then 192.168.0.100

To test this example, open your web browser and enter the
address http://mcbstm32f400/ or http://<boards IP address>

Default user    : admin
Default password: <none>

The HTTP_Server example is available for multiple targets:
