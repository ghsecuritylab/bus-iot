This program is a SMTP_Client example. It shows you how to send emails
from an embedded application.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/Network/html/_s_m_t_p__client__example.html

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). The example will configure the network
parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you need to configure the network
parameters manually in Net_Config_ETH_#.h configuration file. You have to
disable also a 'Dynamic Host Configuration'.

WARNING!!!

You need to modify SMTP_Client_UIF.c user interface and enter:
 - sender email address,
 - recipient email address,
 - email subject,

and optionally for external SMTP authentication:
 - SMTP username,
 - SMTP password.

Modify also the SMTP_Client.c and enter:
 - SMTP server IP address.

Sent email will have about 40 kBytes.
