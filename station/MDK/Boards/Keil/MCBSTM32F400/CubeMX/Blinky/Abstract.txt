The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS based example for
ST 'STM32F407' microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32F400' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            25.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           168.00 MHz

 - LEDs are blinking as running light
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button


The Blinky program is available for target:

  STM32F407 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
